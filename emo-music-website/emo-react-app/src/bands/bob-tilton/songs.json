    "lyrics": "A portrait falls from the wall\nSpace still in the frame and eyes lost from canvas\nYou hung ghost stories there\nThat whisper of initials carved in chestnut bark\nAnd summer's wreath thrown from branches high\n\nThis september song\nThis voice not what it used to be\n\nBut I'll say the words and wear your smile\nI'll say the words and even believe them\nAnd I'll hold your hand while you pierce my side\nI'll hold on tight while you break every bone in me\nThe music stops and I have no chair to sit upon\nI'm outrun and now I track your steps in straight clear lines\n\nFound where you dropped your halo in the snow\nFound an echo of you in an empty house\nWhere once we counted stars beyond reflection\nCut hearts from a cheap cloth and kept them safe for rainy days\n\nNow I am outrun\nAnd linger where the skin wear thin\nWhere first love plays games with penknives\n\nI am naked this september\nYou steamed-opened envelopes this september\nOh this delicate skin",
